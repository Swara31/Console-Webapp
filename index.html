        Windows.Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is
        available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js
        and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes
        (such as .NET and Unity).Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows. Once it is downloaded, run the
        installer (VSCodeUserSetup- {version}.exe). This will only take a minute. By default, VS Code is installed under
        C:\\users\\ {username}\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code.Press the “Open Folder” button in the
        sidebar, or the Open folder… link in the Welcome page. Both will trigger the file picker view. Choose one folder
        where you have source code, or even just text files, and open it. VS Code will show that folder content in your
        view:
